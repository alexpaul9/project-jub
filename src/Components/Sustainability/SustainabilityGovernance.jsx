      Sustainability is deeply embedded in our organizationâ€™s performance, enhancing effectiveness across all departments. A dedicated committee at the Board level reviews our progress on sustainability goals every six months. Furthermore, these sustainability objectives are integrated into the performance of individual functions, with monthly evaluations to ensure accountability and continuous improvement. This structured approach underlines our commitment to sustainability as a fundamental driver of organizational success.
